# Accident-Detection-system
A Web based Accident Detection system

Designed and Developed a Web-Based Vehicle Accident Detection and Tracking Module help to find the location of your loved ones and trace them for you.
This accident alarm system is based on IoT which uses Arduino and GPS.

The AXL MEMS sensors detects the movement of vehicle or we can say accelaration and tells whether it is an accident and which type of accident (left,right or top).
AXL MEMS sensors can detect less than 1 degree.
